## General
Webinterface altered to accept different images than the initial version. 
The [original Files](https://dbdl.floliroy.fr/maps/) (HTML&2D images) were from a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VHZk33Z2WN/), 
almost all 3D images are from a [Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899093390/), the RPD images (3D version) are from the [DBD Fandom Wiki](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Raccoon_City). 


### Use: 
Don't change the names of the subfolders of 2D maps & 3D maps or the images, you can change the name of the mainfolder though. 
Once a new map gets released I'll try to add it as soon as possible, it might take a while tough (cause of the images).  
$${\color{red}The \space callouts \space for \space the \space two \space map \space versions \space (2D/3D) \space are \space different}$$ 
That's why you have to choose which one you want to use as a team, the 2D version is the one that for example Hens' team uses, the 3D versions are easier to understand though (especially for beginners). There are generally no uniform callouts for the clock system, so it is quite common that different teams use different versions. 

### Download: 
If you download the desktop verion of Github you can automatically update the files by [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), otherwise you have to download them again after a new map gets released.  
If you choose to download them normally you only need the folder CalloutMaps (or the subfolder 2D/3D) ^^

## Licence
Just use it with common sence, if you use it write down where you got it from (the git link) and mention that others should do the same.
