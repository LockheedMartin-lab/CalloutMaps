# CalloutMaps
Webinterface altered to accept different images than the initial version. 
The [original Files](https://dbdl.floliroy.fr/maps/) (HTML&2D images) were from a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VHZk33Z2WN/), 
the 3D images are from a [Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899093390/). 

Use:
Don't change the names of the subfolders of 2D maps & 3D maps or the images, you can change the name of the mainfolder though. 

Download:
You only need to download the folder CalloutMaps ^^ 

12: top; 6: bottom (for easier use)


## Licence
Just use it with common sence, if you use it write down where you got it from (the git link) and mention that others should do the same.
