# CalloutMaps
Webinterface altered to accept different images than the initial version. 
The [original Files](https://dbdl.floliroy.fr/maps/) (HTML&2D images) were from a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VHZk33Z2WN/), 
the 3D images are from a [Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899093390/). 

Use:
Don't change the names of the subfolders of 2D maps & 3D maps or the images, you can change the name of the mainfolder though. 

Download:
You only need to download the folder CalloutMaps ^^
